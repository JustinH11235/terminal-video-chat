Graphics options:
- Color in background, gives us rectangle pixels
- Use half-blocks like viu -b, gives us blurry but decent picture, can try to get viuer working or just copy tui-image and improve with half blocks
- Use braille pixels from Canvas library, gives us rectangle pixels but stylized
- viuer, won't be able to integrate as widget for custom kitty graphics, but could overlay on top if I figure out why my thread is breaking it
